💡 Tips:
Use flexbox and/or grid to handle the layout (flex-wrap or grid column auto-fit). If leveraged correctly, you won't need to adjust any layout changes in your media queries.
If you're creating multiple classes that are grouped and share the same css rule, make a single class instead and apply it to those elements. Large groups of css classes that share the same style rule are harder to manage vs a single class.
